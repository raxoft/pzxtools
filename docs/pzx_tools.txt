PZX tools documentation
=======================

The PZX tools suite consists of several tools for converting data to and
from PZX format. Each of these tools reads the data from file given on
command line (or standard input if no file name is specified on command
line) and writes the output to file specified with the -o option (or standard
output if no such file name is specified). Each tool may also have its own
set of additional options, which may be obtained simply by using the -h option.

The purpose of each tool should easy to guess from its name, however here is
the list to make it clear:

tzx2pzx - convert TZX files to PZX files.
tap2pzx	- convert TAP files to PZX files.
csw2pzx	- convert CSW files to PZX files.

pzx2wav - convert PZX files to WAV files.

pzx2txt - dump PZX files to text output.
txt2pzx - create PZX files from text input.

The more detailed of each of these tools follows.

Converting to PZX
=================

tap2pzx
-------

This tool can be used to convert TAP (aka BLK) files to PZX. Normally you
would not need to do that, as TAP files are supported by any emulator which
supports tape files at all, but it may be eventually useful if you would
like to add things which TAP files can't store. This may include things like
textual information about the tape file itself, specific pause blocks
between the data blocks, or browse or stop blocks which may help in case of
multilevel games.
