Welcome to the PZX tools suite.

This suite contains the tools which will allow you to create, examine, and
edit PZX files. PZX files are used to archive the content of the tape files
used by computers like Sinclair ZX Spectrum, much in the same way as TAP or
TZX files are. The difference is that the PZX files allow storing of anything
TZX files can, while being almost as simple to process as the TAP files are.

The suite includes converters from other common formats, namely tzx2pzx for
TZX, tap2pzx for TAP and csw2pzx for CSW. These can be used to convert your
favorite tape files to PZX format. The suite also contains converter to WAV
format, pzx2wav. This is useful for example in case you want to send the
tape file to a real machine via sound output. Finally, there are two
converters which convert the PZX files to and from textual form. These can
be used to examine the content of a PZX file in a human readable form,
conveniently edit or create the content of PZX files in any text editor, or
process or analyze the content by any text processing tool. The suite even
includes few perl scripts which may be used for the latter.

You can find the programs precompiled for Windows platform in the bin/
directory, unless you have downloaded the source only distribution.
The source files themselves are stored in the src/ directory,
simply cd there and run make to build the programs on Linux/Unix platforms.
The scripts for processing the textual form can be found in scripts/ directory.
And last but not least, the documentation can be found in the docs/ directory.

Enjoy!
